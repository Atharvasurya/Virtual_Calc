## Virtual Calculator - AI-Powered Math Solver ðŸ§®âœ¨
Welcome to the Virtual Calculator repository! This project is an innovative AI-powered tool that can solve any math problem, no matter how complex, by interpreting visual drawings. The Virtual Calculator leverages OpenCV for computer vision and gesture recognition, and Google's Gemini LLM model for advanced mathematical problem-solving.

Features
Draw Your Equation: Keep your index finger up to draw equations directly on the screen.
Navigate the Canvas: Use two fingers to move around the canvas effortlessly.
Reset/Erase: Raise your thumb to reset or erase the canvas and start fresh.
Submit for Solving: Use your small finger to submit the drawing for solving.
The user draws the math problem on the screen, and this visual representation is sent to Google's Gemini LLM model. The model interprets the drawing and provides a detailed solution.

How It Works
The Virtual Calculator uses hand gestures detected via OpenCV and MediaPipe to interpret user actions. These actions allow the user to draw, navigate, reset, or submit their math problems. The drawing is then processed by Google's Gemini LLM model, which returns the solution.

Key Components:
OpenCV: For real-time computer vision tasks.
MediaPipe: For hand gesture recognition.
Google's Gemini LLM Model: For interpreting and solving mathematical equations.

# Usage
Draw: Use your index finger to draw equations.
# Navigate: Raise two fingers to navigate the canvas.
# Reset: Raise your thumb to reset the canvas.
# Submit: Raise your small finger to submit the drawing for solving.
